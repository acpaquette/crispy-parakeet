# Licensing

For this project we chose the MIT license. We chose this license for its simplicity. The MIT license is very brief, and very short,
which is nice for inexperienced project maintainers like us, as we do not have to learn a lot of legalese and details about various clauses.
Additionally, this is a very permissible license for us, allowing us to commericalize the project if we ever have the ability to do so.
The MIT license is also very permissible for future forks and contributions, which we hope will ensure that people feel comfortable contributing to the 
project. Finally, the MIT license is seen as been very compatible with other licenses, which will help us should we need to pull in other code,
or any forks want to pull in extensive code from others.
