## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to **crispy-parakeet**, we're glad to welcome your ideas, insights, and technical experience. This document will lay out the maintainers' expectations for any and all contributions.

### Discussions
Github's discussions feature is a great way to get in contact with the maintainer team. It is a great way to "test the waters" so to speak with any potential new feature. If there is something you would like to add, open a discussion about it with the maintainers to see if your goals are aligned with the goals of the project.

### Issues

All contributions should start with a Github issue. This helps us keep everything as organized as possible. Please take advantage of the various issue tags when submitting any bugs, potential changes, etc. Then, assign the issue to yourself, and work on the problem in your own fork of the repository. Please utilize all of the various communication features that Github issues make available.

### Submitting

When you are ready to submit your full contribution, create a pull request connected to the issue. There, a maintainer will review and communicate with you.

### Testing

All PRs are expected to contain unit tests in order to be merged. This helps us see not only that your code is correct, but provides us with a few example use cases as well. In the future, we hope to have a CI/CD pipeline setup with Github actions that will run additional integration tests.
