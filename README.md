Welcome to crispy-parakeet, a reposoitory dedicated to reading a writing NASAs Parameter Value Language (PVL).

This package plans to be a light weight and fast PVL parsing tool, designed around C/C++ and uses a single pass read approach when ingesting PVL data to make reads as fast and seemless as possible for users.

For more details regarding PVL, checkout the language specification provided by NASA [here](https://pvl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_downloads/3eb86e5f16e283d04719e72d06935e91/CCSDS-641.0-B-2-PVL.pdf). This document covers how to correctly read and write PVL so we will be strictly adhereing to it for development and testing.
